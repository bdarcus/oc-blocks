EXPERIMENTAL

The new native citation support in =org-mode= provides unmatched features and flexibility.
This project provides remixable components for users and developers to assemble custom =org-cite= interfaces.

- An "insert processor" for integration with =org-cite-insert=, and which offers:
    - Style selection and editing.
    - Reference insertion and editing, with configurable =completing-read=, =ivy=, and =helm= front-ends, using a common =bibtex-completion= backend
- "follow processors" for =org-open-at-point= integration (not sure about this actually)
